# Kohai-Chess
UCI Chess Engine, a derivative of Senpai 1.0 

Kōhai 1.0 Copyright (C) 2016 by Fabien Letouzey and Michael Byrne.

Kōhai 1.0 is a direct derivative of Senpai 1.0.  The changes made are very modest and were related to LMR Reductions and piece values.  I estimate the increase to be about modest ~10 ELO over Senpai 1.0.  

Note - Fabien did not participate in this endeavor, however, Fabian is listed as the primary author, because it is primarily his work.  However, if you find any fault with this software, please attribute the fault to me

I thank Fabien for all of his contributions to chess programming - from his original work in Fruit, we have seen the fruition of his labor in other chess programs, most notably Glaurung by Tord Romstad and its well know derivative and prestigious Stockfish program.

I encourage others to make contributions to Kōhai as it will be posted Github.  One area of interest, would be to add SYZYGY tablebase endgame support.

Today is 2014-03-17.
Senpai is a chess engine that uses the UCI protocol.
You need a graphical interface supporting UCI to use Senpai.
Have fun with Senpai!
